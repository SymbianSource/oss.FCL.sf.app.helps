Put the play, record and stop symbols in front of the bracketed record, play and stop/rewind
in the Quick Start topic.

In other topics, replace the word play, record or stop with the appropriate symbols.
Note that these words are lower case bold in the original W4W file.
The uppercase words refer to the screen buttons in the Record program and should not
be replaced.

In total the play (triangle) should occur 8 times, the record (round) 7 times and
the stop (square) 4 times.
